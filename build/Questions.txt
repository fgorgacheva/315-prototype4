Questions

The theory I was testing:
Do you players follow instructions or do they prefer to fuck around and find out?


1. How did the game make you feel? 

2. What were your initial thoughts? 

3. Did you or did you not want to kill the bunny? Were you reluctant or did you just want to see what happens? 

4. How did you feel about the instructions being a little more self-explanatory than explicitly explained?

5. If you have extra thoughts/feelings please write them below.
