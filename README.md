**********************
**    HYPOTHESIS    **
**********************
Can players follow implicit instructions or do they prefer to experiment and figure things out on their own?



**********************
**      DESIGN      **
**********************
A sword and a bunny, the bunny duplicates. The player must kill the bunny before it duplicates to infinity.


**********************
**  PLAYTEST NOTES  **
**********************
- one grabbed sword and immediately killed bunny, second playthrough saw duplication faster and decided to prevent again, third playthtough decided to see what happens
- offers replayability which is nice 



***************************
**    FOLLOW UP NOTES    **
***************************
- suggestion, make this into a maze so that bunny is first thing you see, this will allow player to explore, no pressure and no distress, then second room offer the sword as they continue. Bunny will begin to replicate in that room, player will not necessarily know and will continue ahead to find  another suspicious bunny that also beginns to replicate, if the player backtraccks to see first bunny, will see that they duplicate but it's already too late --> doom player on first playthrough, they have to replay to figure out the solution to not dying --> essentially don't give the answer right away
